## Introduction

RabbitMQ is a message broker: it accepts and forwards messages.
You can think about it as a post office: when you put the mail that you want posting in a post box, you can be sure 
that Mr. Postman will eventually deliver the mail to your recipient. In this analogy, RabbitMQ is a post box,
a post office and a postman. 
The major difference between RabbitMQ and the post office is that it doesn't deal with paper, 
instead it accepts, stores and forwards binary blobs of data â€’ messages. 
RabbitMQ, and messaging in general, uses some jargon.
